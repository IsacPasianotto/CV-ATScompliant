The original template was created by Prashant Singh, it can be found on overleaf [at this link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/70-plus-ats-rating-resume-template/ssprfsctyddz) and was released under the [Creative Comons CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

The modification with respect to the original template was to split the single file into one-task multiple files, in order to make it more modular and easier to maintain.
